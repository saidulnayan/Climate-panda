Climate panda is a mobile game that utilizes NASA's climate change data to educate people. The climatic change has become a global concern over the last few decades and has various impacts on the ecosystem and ecology. First We collected the data to build a predictive model by machine learning.

Then we designed an interactive data-driven mobile game using Flutter. In this strategic game, users will learn about the impacts of climate change through statistical data and by making the right decision. If it's too hot then what, buy an AC or plant a tree? The decisions made by the user will update the statistics and gives a detailed description. By reading, analyzing, and playing, users of age 10 to 60 will learn about climate change. Learning is a scientific process that includes vision, sound, and practice. We combined this three and designed an interactive learning app where users will learn through stories, statistics, and making decisions. This user interaction and applied statistics will increase the awareness of Climate change.

A recent report from the United Nations predicted that the average global temperature could increase by 6Ëš Celsius at the end of the century. The ocean level is rising, glaciers are melting, CO2 in the air is increasing, forest and wildlife are declining, and water life is also getting disturbed due to climatic changes. If we do not do anything and things continue to go on like right now then a day in the future will come when humans will become extinct from the surface of the earth. To reach out to a huge population, we need a smart approach. Around 83% of the world population uses smartphones and there are more than 1.3 billion active mobile game users only in Asia. So, we grabbed this opportunity and designed a mobile game to educate this huge audience. Anyone between the age of 10 to 60 will learn from our app and that will be our greatest achievement.
