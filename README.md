# Climate-panda
Climate panda is a mobile game that utilizes NASA's climate change data to educate people. First We collected the data to build a predictive model by machine learning. Then we designed an interactive data-driven mobile game using Flutter. In this strategic game, users will learn about the impacts of climate change through statistical data and by making the right decision. If it's too hot then what, buy an AC or plant a tree? The decisions made by the user will update the statistics and gives a detailed description. By reading, analyzing &amp; playing, users of age 10 to 60 will learn about climate change. This user interaction and applied statistics will increase the awareness of Climate change.
