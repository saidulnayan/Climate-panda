The climatic change has become a global concern over the last few decades and having various impacts on the ecosystem and ecology. First We collected the data to build a predictive model by machine learning. Then we designed an interactive data-driven mobile game using Flutter and Adobe XD. In this strategic game, users will learn about the impacts of climate change through statistical data and by making the right decision. If it's too hot then what, buy an AC or plant a tree? The decisions made by the user will update the statistics and gives a detailed description. By reading, analyzing, and playing, users of age 10 to 60 will learn about climate change. This user interaction and applied statistics will increase the awareness of Climate change.
